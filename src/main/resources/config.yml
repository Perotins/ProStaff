# too much.


# How many slots should the inventory have? Must be a multiple of 9
inventory-size: 27


# Which slot should we start placing the heads of staff members in and which slot should we end in before making a new
# page?
# NOTE: If you are having trouble visualing this then try googling "Bukkit inventory slots layout" and then look at the images!
# Programmatically things start from 0, so the first slot is actually 0 and the last slot is 53 not 54 (if working with 6 rows)
start-slot: 0
end-slot: 8

# Which slot should we put the previous page button in?
# NOTE: The same rules apply from above. Meaning that 0 is the first slot. Also take note that the slot number has to be less than the
# inventory-size and cannot be within the start and end range!

previous-page-slot: 20

# Which slot should we put the next page button in?
# NOTE: All rules apply from the previous page button! Take note to make this number less than inventory-size, not the same as the previous
# page button and not within the range of the start and end range!

next-page-slot: 24

# Which slot should we put the vanish and unvanish button in?
# NOTE: All rules apply from above, if you haven't read them by now then you should because you can mess up the menu
# by not taking note of those things!
